pngpeg converts .png files to .jpeg (JFIF) files <br /> <br />

Clone to desired directory. <br />
Build using "cargo build --release". <br />
Place binary found in target/build/release into directory with desired image file. <br />
Type "pngpeg <REPLACE WITH INPUT FILENAME>.png <REPLACE WITH OUTPUT FILENAME>.jpg" in the terminal. <br /> <br />

Currently, pngpeg is W.I.P. The PNG decoder is complete, and the JPEG encoder is about 75% complete.
